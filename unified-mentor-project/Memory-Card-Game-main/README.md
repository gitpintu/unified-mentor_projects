### Memory-Card-Game

**Playing a memory card game on a computer can be a fun and engaging activity. Here are general instructions on how you can play a memory card game:**

## How To PLay:
**1)** Memory card games typically involve a grid of face-down cards, each with a matching pair. <br>
       The objective is to find all the matching pairs by flipping over two cards. <br>
       If the two cards match, they stay face-up. If not, they are turned face-down again. <br>
**2)** To play this game you have to click on "Start" button or you can also start it by flipping the first card. <br>
**3)** After starting the game click on any two cards to flip them over. <br>
       If the cards match, they will stay face-up. <br>
       If the cards don't match, they will flip back face-down, and you'll need to remember their positions. <br>
       Continue flipping pairs until you've matched all the cards. <br>
**4)** Once you've matched all the pairs, you win the game. <br>
       Then it will display how many moves and seconds you needed to complete the game. <br>
**5)** Take your time, enjoy the process, and challenge yourself to improve your memory and speed. <br>
**6)** If you want to play again, restart the game by clicking on "New Game" button.
