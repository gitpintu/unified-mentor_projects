HTML (index.html):
The HTML file sets up the structure of the game.
It includes a game board, a message to display the current player's turn, and a reset button.
The game board is a 3x3 grid where players can place X or O marks.

CSS (style.css):
The CSS file contains styling rules for the game elements.
It ensures that the game board and buttons have an attractive layout.
Cell elements in the game board are styled as squares with proper spacing and a hover effect on the reset button.

JavaScript (script.js):
The JavaScript code controls the game's logic and interaction.
It tracks the current player (X or O), updates the display message, and handles player moves on the board.
It checks for win conditions and a draw, updating the message accordingly.
The reset button allows players to start a new game.

This code provides a foundation for a basic Tic Tac Toe game that can be played on both desktop and mobile devices. Users can take turns, and the game determines the winner or a draw.
